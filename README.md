# Adi's Engineering Portfolio

## Projects
### Unmanned Aerial Systems â€“ Air Force Research Laboratory
- The Emergency Access and Ground-Link Explorer (EAGLE)
  - Worked with CAD software to brainstorm/design drones to compete in the NIST competition
  - Presented work/research in the Fall Undergraduate Research Expo

### Airfoil Angle of Attack Optimizer
- Used XFOIL to run airfoil simulations at various angles of attack for different NACA 4-digit airfoils
- Passed data through MATLAB to maximize lift, minimize drag, and maximize the ratio

### Semi-autonomous 3D Printed Prosthetic Hand
- Designed,3D printed, and assembled prosthetic hand-controlled through fishing line and stepper
motors connected to Arduino Mega
- Uses camera and machine learning to identify hand signs of a real hand and replicate them on the
prosthetic
